we make Dodkerfile 

inside file write 

from base image -- whatever we see from pulll we can use as base image. 

WORKDIR /app

COPY script.sh 


# make the script executable

RUN chmod +x script.sh


# run the scripts when yhe container starts 

CMD["./scripts.sh"]


in script.sh inside -- 

  echo "message yu want to show after initialise ."


command after do all things in terminal :docker build -t name . this . is show current directory .





-------------------change in scripts file .

when you cahnge it you need to agin build it than it run . 



---------------------some extra buil refiement --------------------

docker build --no-cache -t mydockerimage . 


mean it not check layer with previous docker image is buil from scratch . 

it is build litbit slow becuse in previous it just check what file is same take it from there . 


-------------------putting tags in our images ----------------


same code as we build images just we need to add : tag which we want 


exmp : - 

 docker build -t mydockerimage:v1.0  .    - it image show it tags is v1 



--so we know each change we have to make a new build so we just placed tagged to furture feature inside it and put tsg on it so it easy to understande which we need according to requirement .



-----------------------------ignorefile -------------------

we dont want to .ev file when we build a immage containre so we use .dockerignore 

suppose when you working in nodejs so there is node module echich we dont want to go to image
