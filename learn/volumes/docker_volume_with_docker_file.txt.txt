# create volume at the time of 

FROM ubuntu 
VOLUME ["/data"]

-------------
the line volume /data in the Dockerfile is an instruction that tells docker to create a mount point for a volume inside the container . it specifies that the directory /data should be treated as volume .

it mean that any data written to or read from the /data directory within the container will be stored outside the container in a volume .

Note : - that the VOLUME  instruction in the Dockerfile does not create the volume itself . 
----------------


in terminal 

docker build -t myimage 

docker run --name c1 -itd -v myvol:/data imagesname /bin/bash (this bin bash is run container in background )
