in this we learn some basic command which is most used . 

for all you have visit to docker docs

------------------command use din docker ----------------------

1 = docker -v  or docker -version           - for check which version is you used docker .
2 = docker info              - show information based on sytem . and also based on clien if run .
3 = 

   docker image you can make or pull from docker hub to run own conatiner 

   command - docker pull and code command to install paticular images .

    examp - docker pull hello-world     or docker image pull option and tags  by default latest tags is placed .

       a testing images .

4 = docker image                      - check and show how many images you have in docker . 

5 = docker search and repo-name          help to search repo from cli .

6 =  docker ps    or docker ps -a -( it show exited conatainer ) and so many other check docer hub . it show only running container 
        check how many container you have made in docker . 

if you want to know extra about the conatiner : 0 run this command 

docker inspect and conatiner id -- we have also give some line of id it auto detect because container id is so long ,




create container -------------------------------------------------------------



docker run or images name or tags - we run hello-world it start or end after running some py files .

eachh time conatiner made run and stop because it not process until it not runn in background .
. 

you can create multiple images from one images . 

command : - 


7 =  docker run image name . or img id  


now create another container with same name images .

so install you need to add tag which install at time images .

docker run hello-world:latest - if you specifie anotehr tag it pull from repo and make conatianer .

--------random name use when create you should also give your name -------------------

docker run --name #name you want, image name 



now lets do something with another images . ------------------------------

we are install python slim tags because it size is less so it start fast .



# running conatiner in backgroud so it can run continously . -----------using option --detact or -d 


8 = docker run --name name -d images names or id .

  it is also create or stop because theire is no continious process happen .

# now running in intractive mode so it run continiously . --------------------------------------------


9 = docker run --name name -i -t -d image name with tags  also -itd is enough . 

in this 

  i = itractive - open in itractive mode and allow standard input .
  t = provide intractive terminal session 

  it not send you to terminal but now you conatainer run in background and not stop . because we make a sesiion for terminal .

10 = getting terminal when open container in iterative and terminal session ---------------using docker exec .



docker exec conatiner name  -it and interpreter provide by in which type od conatiner we made . in web show alpine it a ios terminal . 

it only run which container is running up in -itd mode s. 


command - docker exec pythpn-c3 -it and shell/cmd/interpreter = 

you can find which shell we we have to write it . 

so you have inspect it and check cmd there is written what is you have to write it in that place .



# now check what is happen when we not use -d to make a container  . 


docker run --name python-c4 -it python:slim 


so it directly send you to terminal . 



# noe we want to work with a new container and after work dane it auto delete when exit ---------------

--called flag 

docker run --name pytohn-c5 -it --rm pytohn:slim 

it use when you want to work on temporary container --


# ----------------stop docker container ----------------


docker stop python-c3 

that .its 



# -------------how start conatiner after make container ------------------

-- it run conatiner at the time of creating conatiner ------- so how we start again from scratch -----------


command : - 

docker start container name 

Note : - in which type you intialise your container at the time of making container with imagess 

so next time when you run it using start it carry froward all setiings .


# docker Restart 


start stop restart work when it open in interative modes . 



# delete container ---------------------------


docker rm container name and id . 


# --------------------------------remove docker images -------------------------------------

docker rmi - mean rm images

conditions : - before delete images you have to delete all containers which made from those images . 

# remove multiple docker conatiner at onces -------------------------------------------

command : - docker container prune 

------------------------all images deleted --------------------

docker system prune 

this will delele all images at onces .


-------------------------------docker logs --------------------------------

mean somethings got error when runn in conatiner his error show in logs  

command : - 

  docker logs conatiner name
